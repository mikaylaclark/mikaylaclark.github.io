                  <p>Before our semester ended abruptly due to the Covid-19 pandemic, my team,
                     Ocean Alliance, and I were working on this incredible project. I was the leader of the
                     FrontEnd team, and we were working hard to make these wire frames come to life.</p>
                  <p>JumboCode is an organization at Tufts that helps local non-profits with free programming
                     services. My team and I were helping Ocean Alliance Whale Conservation to build a program
                     that identified whale types from whale footage by using machine learning to distinguish
                     between blowholes. After identifying which kind of whale a certain whale in uploaded footage is,
                     we would store these videos in a sorted gallery.</p>
                  <p>My team and I used HTML, JavaScript, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap to build our interface. Although
                     we were unable to finish, I was and still am extremely passionate about this project. I learned
                     how to work with other teams like the BackEnd and Machine Learning teams towards a common goal.</p>
