                  <p>This pinball machine was created through my Electrical Engineering for
                     Mechanical Engineers class here at Tufts for a project. My partner and 
                     I used 3D printing to create the obstacles on the board. We also used
                     lazer cutting to create the board, board walls, and standing legs.</p>
                  <p>In order to add up points, we had to get creative and use copper tape
                     and a small metal ball to complete the circuit and send an electrical
                     signal to an Arduino. Once this Arduino received the signal, it sent 
                     this information to our small display and added a point onto the user's
                     score. The display showed the score to the user at all times while playing
                     the game, and updated the score whenever the user hit an obstacle with
                     copper tape. Additionally, we were able to connect a Servo motor to the
                     pin wheel to spin the wheel at a constant speed. We also used a small
                     Solenoid to move up and down on the board through a drill-cut hole
                     to add more difficulty in playing the game. The levers to push the
                     ball back up onto the board were actually door stops that had a spring-
                     like body to add momentum easily to the levers.</p>
