                  <p>Before our semester ended abruptly due to the Covid-19 pandemic, my team,
                     Ocean Alliance, and I were working on this incredible project. I was the leader of the
                     FrontEnd team, and we were working hard to make these wire frames come to life. Our team
                     created these wire frames using Adobe Xd, and as we worked on our code, we updated them
                     as needed.</p>
                  <p>JumboCode is an organization at Tufts that helps local non-profits with free programming
                     services. My team and I were helping Ocean Alliance Whale Conservation to build a program
                     that identified whale types from whale footage by using machine learning to distinguish
                     between blowholes. After identifying which kind of whale a certain whale in uploaded footage is,
                     we would store these videos in a sorted gallery.</p>
                  <p>My team and I used HTML, JavaScript, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap to build our interface. Although
                     we were unable to finish, I was and still am extremely passionate about this project. I learned
                     how to work with other teams like the BackEnd and Machine Learning teams towards a common goal.</p>

                  <p>I created a wireframe of the popular game, Space Invaders, in my Research Methods for Engineering
                     Psychology class at Tufts. I used Axure to create my user-friendly interface and prototype.</p>
                  <p>This was a super fun project, and it was the first time I used any kind of wire framing tools.</p>
                  <p>I learned good UI practices by keeping in mind the usability and flow for the user. I made the "Up"
                     arrow on a keyboard the shoot button, and the "Left" and "Right" arrows allowed the user to move
                     left and right. I wanted to make the controls as intuitive and user-friendly as possible.</p>
