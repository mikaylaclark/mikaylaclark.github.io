                  <p>This project was created through careful user-centered product design
                     in my Mechanical Design and Fabrication class. My team and I created a list of 
                     challenges that students on the Tufts campus face daily by observing
                     students on campus.</p>
                  <p>Through dot voting with sticky notes, we narrowed the challenges to
                     one main challenge and framed a design problem. We then created a stakeholder
                     map to identify everyone who is impacted by our design problem and map out
                     their relationships.</p>

                  <p>Design problem statement: <i>"College students who live in dorms have
                     the problem of <b>getting locked out by forgetting their IDs</b> when
                     leaving their dorm. Our solution should deliver a <b>reliable,
                     non-damaging, and easy to use</b> method of preventing lockouts."</i></p>

                  <p>In order to understand who our users are and what they need, we carefully
                     created an unbiased survey on Qualtrics and received approximately 250 responses. 
                     We analyzed the data recevied from the survey, created a user profile
                     for similar groups of people or demographics and used an affinity diagram
                     to organize these groups. After reviewing our user profile groups, we created
                     personas to help us better understand potential users affected by our problem
                     statement.</p>
                   <p>To get an even deeper understanding of our potential user, we performed
                      a task analysis to understand what our users' goals are, what they are
                      trying to achieve, and what they usually do to achieve these goals.</p>
                   <p>Then, we identified user needs and engineering requirements for our device.
                      To organize these needs and requirements by importance, we used another
                      affinity diagram. To then understand what needs were satisfied by others,
                      we did some benchmarking using a market research and information research
                      on current products on the market.</p>
                   <p>Finally, after completing ideation techniques like mind mapping, function
                      structures and brainwriting 6-3-5, we began our prototyping and fabrication
                      process. We used Computer Aided-Design, 3D printing, laser cutting, drilling,
                      circuits and motors, metal cutting, and an Arduino to create our artifact.</p>
                   <p>In the end, we created a device that lowered a thin piece of metal in between
                      a door frame and the tongue of the door with a Servo motor to prevent the door 
                      from closing for a set amount of time. This allowed for a grace period for
                      the user to realize they forgot their key to their dorm room, and to come
                      back into the room and retreive it before the door locked. The user was able
                      to set a preferred amount of time for this grace period using a pedometer.
                      The device was activated using a touch sensor as the user was exiting their
                      dorm room, and when the grace period was over, the Servo motor would remove
                      the metal piece from the door frame. This device is able to attach to the 
                      wall on the inside of the user's room.</p>

                  <p>This pinball machine was created through my Electrical Engineering for
                     Mechanical Engineers class here at Tufts for a project. My partner and 
                     I used 3D printing to create the obstacles on the board. We also used
                     lazer cutting to create the board, board walls, and standing legs.</p>
                  <p>In order to add up points, we had to get creative and use copper tape
                     and a small metal ball to complete the circuit and send an electrical
                     signal to an Arduino. Once this Arduino received the signal, it sent 
                     this information to our small display and added a point onto the user's
                     score. The display showed the score to the user at all times while playing
                     the game, and updated the score whenever the user hit an obstacle with
                     copper tape. Additionally, we were able to connect a Servo motor to the
                     pin wheel to spin the wheel at a constant speed. We also used a small
                     Solenoid to move up and down on the board through a drill-cut hole
                     to add more difficulty in playing the game. The levers to push the
                     ball back up onto the board were actually door stops that had a spring-
                     like body to add momentum easily to the levers.</p>
