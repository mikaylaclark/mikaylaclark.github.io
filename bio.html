                            <h1>Background</h1>
                            <p>I have lived in a small town called Cornwall, NY my whole life. My mom grew up in this town, as well as my grandmother and her parents.
                               I was, as some people call it, and "accident", but I certainly was meant to be on this earth for one reason: to be a computer programmer
                               and an engineer! But seriously, my mom never regretted me one bit. I didn't live with my dad, who lived in Florida for the duration of
                               my childhood. I saw him a good amount and we had a good relationship. My grandmother (who is also my neighbor and is the supplier of
                               whatever we don't have in the house) is like my mom. I lived at her house growing up, and she is truly my best friend.</p>
                            <h2>Interests</h2>
                            <p>Growing up, I had an intense interest in the arts. I loved singing, dancing, and playing the violin and piano. I started singing as soon
                               as I could talk, and I took and still take singing lessons to better my skills. I have danced since I was 3 years old, and danced up until
                               I graduated high school. I met some of my  best friends through this amazing experience. On the other hand, I had a vast love for science
                               and math; and I met some of my other best friends through these classes.</p>
                            <h3>College</h3>
                            <p>And now I am gratefully attending Tufts University, and I couldn't be more proud to be able to say I got into this school. I love everyone
                               I've met here, and they continue to push me to better myself and be the best version of myself I can be. I had a hard time figuring out
                               what I wanted to do with my life, since I am so artistic and also into STEM subjects. After being torn between a bunch of different options
                               (and yes, being a singer was an option) and taking some awesome classes in Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Architecture, and
                               general science classes, I came to the decision of double majoring in Human Factors Engineering and Computer Science! I haven't
                               regretted it since, even though it is a lot of work. I enjoy and appreciate everyday I have in college and I wouldn't change anything!</p>
