                            <p>Hi! I am a junior at Tufts University pursuing a BS degree
                               Human Factors Engineering and Computer Science.</p>
                            <h2>Interests</h2>
                            <p>I have many interests in both User Experience and Software
                               Engineering. Through my courses, I have developed a passion
                               for creating and designing user-centered products. I also
                               am interested in machine learning, virtual reality, augmented
                               reality, and artificial intelligence. I am actively searching
                               for user experience, product design, user research, backend
                               development and frontend development internships.</p>
