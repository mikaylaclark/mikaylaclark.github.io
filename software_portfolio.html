                  <p>This project was created for my Web Programming class at Tufts University.
                     I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB to complete it. I was able to 
                     use the Google Maps API to dynamically display cars onto the map using
                     car markers. I then used the Geolocation API to find my (the user's) location 
                     and also display that onto the map with a generic red location marker.</p>
                  <p>I computed the distance between the user's location and each car's location, 
                     and found the closest car and displayed that onto the screen when the user 
                     clicked their location marker. A line was drawn from the user's location to the
                     closest car's location marker. I used MongoDB to store the car location
                     information. This made my code more modular.</p>
