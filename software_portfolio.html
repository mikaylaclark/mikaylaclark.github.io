                  <p>This project was created for my Web Programming class at Tufts University.
                     I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB to complete it. I was able to 
                     use the Google Maps API to dynamically display cars onto the map using
                     car markers. I then used the Geolocation API to find my (the user's) location 
                     and also display that onto the map with a generic red location marker.</p>
                  <p>I computed the distance between the user's location and each car's location, 
                     and found the closest car and displayed that onto the screen when the user 
                     clicked their location marker. A line was drawn from the user's location to the
                     closest car's location marker. I used MongoDB to store the car location
                     information. This made my code more modular.</p>

                  <p>This project was created for my Object-Oriented Programming class at Tufts University.
                     I worked with a team to bring this awesome project to life. We used WebGazer.js to 
                     track eye movements on a screen to recreate the popular educational game, Kahoot. Instead
                     of needing to use a web-enabled device to input the user's answer, the user simply needed
                     to look at the multiple choice answer they want to choose to enter it.</p>
                  <p>We wanted to take into consideration eye strain on the screen, so we set a 7 second break
                     period after the user chose an answer to rest their eyes. Additionlly, we muted out the colors
                     of the choices on the screen to give the user's eyes a break as well. We also used colors that would be
                     lighter on the user's eyes. We also were aware of potential color blind users, so we used 
                     colors that worked with color blindness.</p>
                  <p>We included timers to count down time for each screen, and we also kept track of the user's
                     score in the bottom right corner. This project was super fun to work on, as I have never used
                     WebGazer.js before this, so it was interesting and rewarding to learn how to use this library.</p>
